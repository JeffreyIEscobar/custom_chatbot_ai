The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (\\( c \\)) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (\\( a \\) and \\( b \\)). This can be written as:\n\n\\[\nc^2 = a^2 + b^2\n\\]\n\nIf you provide the lengths of the sides of the triangle, I can help you calculate \\( x \\).
